**SITUATION REPORT**  
An enemy attack has broken through which may force a withdrawal of troops at the front. Your battlegroup has been held in reserve to counter. Move fast to intercept and halt the enemy breakthrough.

Both sides are on the move, there is little time for preparation.

**Scenario Type**: Meeting Engagement 

**TERRAIN**   
Set up the terrain in any mutually agreed manner.

**VICTORY**  
Victory Points are scored cumulatively until the VP limit is reached:  
Capturing an Objective (+3VP)  
Enemy Unit slain (+1VP)  
Slay the Warlord (+1VP)  
Out-Scouted (+1VP)

The recommended VP limit is triple the number of objectives on the field, plus the average unit count of all players rounded down.

**DEPLOYMENT**   
**1\. Determine table corners**  
Both sides roll a D6 and add the number of Recon units in their army. The player with the highest total chooses which table corner will be his deployment zone, the opponent automatically gets the opposite table corner. 

**2\. Place Objectives**  
Place D3+2 objectives on the table. The side that chose deployment zones places the first, then both sides alternate placement.

**3\. Reconnaissance Forces**  
Players alternate deploying all Recon units in the same order. These can be placed anywhere in their half of the table, but not within 12" of the table’s centerline. Units alternate Infiltrate deployments after all other units are placed.

Recon units may be declared held in reserves instead of deploying. The side that deployed more Recon units may claim the Out-Scouted secondary objective.  
If one side has deployed no units, then the opponent may position their units anywhere on the table on Ambush Fire.   
**4\. Turn 0**  
Both players roll a D6 adding the number of units deployed in step 3\. The side with the highest total takes the first turn. On a tie, the side that deployed the most Recon units wins.

**5\. Main Force Arrival**  
From turn 1 onwards, players bring in units from reserves equal to the turn number. Units entering the board may be placed fully within 6” of the player’s table edge (24" each direction from the table corner). Continue this until all the forces are on the tabletop.

\*For every 2000 points of game size, roll an additional D3
