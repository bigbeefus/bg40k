**SITUATION REPORT**  
The enemy have already been under heavy artillery fire, and are already weakened. Spearhead an assault to break through the lines.

**Scenario Type**: Attack/Defense

**TERRAIN**   
Set up the terrain in any mutually agreed manner.

**VICTORY**  
Victory Points are scored cumulatively until the VP limit is reached:  
Capturing an Objective (+3VP)  
Enemy Unit slain (+1VP)  
Slay the Warlord (+1VP)  
Out-Scouted (+1VP)

The recommended VP limit is triple the number of objectives on the field, plus the average unit count of all players rounded down.

**RESERVES**  
Reserves enter the table in waves. During the game, one unit, plus one for every 1000 points of game limit will arrive as a wave where noted.

**1\. Determine Table Edges**  
The defender may choose which of the short table edges the Attacker must deploy on. He gets the opposite table edge. 

**2\. Attacker’s Forces**  
**Probing Force**   
The probing force must include all the Attacker’s Recon units and one wave of reserves as described above.

**Main Force**  
The rest of the attacker’s battlegroup are his main force. From turn 3 onwards, one wave will enter the board from the attacker’s table edge at the beginning of each turn.

**3\. Determine Initial Defenders**   
The defender may select up to half of their units, plus any Fortifications to start. All other units are placed in reserves.

**4\. Defender’s Reinforcements**  
From turn 5 onwards one wave will arrive each turn from his table edge, until all units are on the tabletop.

**5\. Objective Placement**  
The defender places two objectives in the front line zone, and one anywhere else on the table, with the usual restrictions. The defender may not claim all objectives secured victory. 

**6\. Deploy Initial Defenders** Place all the initial defenders in the front line zone. D3 units may start the game on the Ambush Fire order. 

**7\. Deploy Attacker’s Probing Force**  
The attacker’s probing force units are placed within 12" of the attacker’s table edge. 

**8\. Resolve Bombardment**  
Each of the defender’s non-vehicle units must take a Pinning test. Vehicles must pass a leadership check, or count as Crew Stunned at the start of the game.

**10\. First Turn**  
The attacker takes the first turn.
